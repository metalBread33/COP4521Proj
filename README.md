# COP4521Proj
Students enrolled in COP 4521 this semester are required to develop a project on Python web application development. The goal of this project is to create a web application that displays news from the Hacker News portal. 
The project has to feature pages for Sign Up/Login, News Feed, Profile, and Admin. Every news item on the news page will include a Like and Dislike button. Users have the option to like or dislike a news item, and the most popular items are
displayed at the top of the news feed. The Auth0 platform should validate each user's identity.

The url for this project is here: https://gasstationpillsformybeloved.com/

There is a small bug where sometimes the number of likes and dislikes a post has does not increase properly. It is stored correctly and it will be displyed as such eventually.
